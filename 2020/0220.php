<p><span class="drop">T</span>oday is just another day
well, some would have you believe that. But if you allow
yourself to grasp hold of today and see what happens,
you are able to take a better hold of today than you
originally thought.</p>

<p>13:00</p>

<p>Uh, yeah all of that. Not sure what I was even saying.
  trying to figure that out right now.</p>

<p>I think I was trying to say that if you grab hold of
  what you can accomblish today, not worrying about
  tomorrow until it gets here (yet still being prepared
  for the tomorrow that might come) you are able to
  better handle whatever comes your way today.</p>

<p>Yep! Exactly that!</p>
