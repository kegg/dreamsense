<p><span class="drop">S</span>o much noise going on in the 
house. Not sure what to do
about all of it. Just lots of noise. I'm not a fan of noise,
not in the least. It's a bit overwhelming. I'd rather not
have to deal with any of it, but well you know it happens.</p>

<p>I'd rather not deal with the noise. I mean, I've already got noise going on 
in my own head, why would I want the extra noise to be there? Doesn't make sense 
right? No, I didn't think so. Well, here's to the noise that I'm trying to deal 
with.</p>

<p>Noise comes in so many levels and functions. There's visual noise, auditory 
noise... probably others I can't even think of at the moment. But if it can 
affect your senses, it can be noise.</p>
