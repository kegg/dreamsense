<p><span class="drop">T</span>he end was near. It always was near.
No one could tell you otherwise. Such a fact had to be known and
understood before anything else. I'm not the person who made the
rules. I do follow such rules as anyone else in the world. It is a gift
granted to all.</p>

<p>Some would have you wonder how is this a gift. Well, to obey and to be
obedient to rules that govern you, allow you to be protected. Without laws or
rules in place, we as a people become in danger of destroying ourselves.</p>

<p>Not everyone understands or grasps the concept of full obedience. Not
everyone can live up to such an idea. I guess that's what makes us all human.
Standing out for something doesn't automatically make it taken care of or easy.
In order to achieve a good, you must keep moving forward with it. Every step
must be consciously made with considerable effort and determination.</p>

<p>That might be where I failed. Yes, somewhere along that mystical road of
dreaming I managed to find myself lost to a point in time. I never recovered
from or understood. That was the start of my downfall.</p>

<p>I didn't always expect my life to turn out the way it did. Talk about quite a
game changer. I'd have to say life was annoying at best.</p>

<p>My problems began the moment I was conceived and only grew worse as time went
on.</p>

<p>This is that <a href="mental-illness.php">story</a>.</p>

<p>The nightmare always began and ended the same. Only the middle would change
from time to time and yet that remained predictable. The torture wouldn't change
for some time. I grew tired of the dreams quite easily but that did me no
good.</p>

<p>They persisted.</p>

<p>Talk about an annoyance. Not a simple annoyance mind you. No, that would be
something I could brush off. It had nothing so easy in it. No, this was
something quite more manipulative and sinister in nature.</p>

<p>But no one talks about it. People like to brush things under a rug as it
were. Not everything can simply be avoided mind you. Not all can be buried that
easily.</p>

<p>Sometimes we don't ask all the necessary questions. They can have the
tendency to make us think more than we should want to.</p>

<p>The questions can be deep or they can be simple. Either one has the ability
to make a person wonder even deeper things. I suppose the most basic question
asked really can lead a person down a rabbit hole, as it were.</p>

<p>Why<br/>What<br/>When<br/>Where<br/>How</p>

<p>All simple one word questions which can lead to much deeper disucssions. Talk
about a rush.</p>
