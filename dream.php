<p><span class="drop">A</span>h dreams, here we are with the dreams. 
  Dreams come and go long before we
  are able to understand and comprehend them. They are sometimes the inner
  most desires of our heart.</p>

<p>A dream can mean many things to different people. It doesn't always have to 
mean the same thing to you or them or anyone else. YOU are your own dreamer. 
Make sure that you determine what your dreams mean.</p>
