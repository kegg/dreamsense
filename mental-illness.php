<h2>January 22, 2020</h2>

<p><span class="drop">T</span>ime didn't exist for the man in the white room.
  The green ball smiled back at him. A smile of all things. Why would a
  smile even matter at this point in the game?</p>
<p>He's a stress ball. I squeeze him. So why the smile? If you got squoze,
  would you be smiling? I doubt it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="img/squoze.jpg"><br>
  <span class="p10">Yes, he really exists.</p>
<p>Maybe he knew they did a check on me. That's possible. And he's just
  laughing at me. Silly stress ball, staring back at me with his green
  self.</p>
<p>One has to wonder how and why he can smile at me. Where does that smile
  come from? I wish I could smile back and feel normal again.</p>
<p>What exactly is normal?</p>
<p>How do you grasp onto it? WHen they gave me the stress ball they took him
  away from his friends. He's alone. He only has me, so he won't be alone
  for long. Silly stress ball.</p>
<p>If our positions were reversed, would I be the one smiling at the human?</p>
<p>Who is the human and who is the stress ball?</p>
<p>When you can't decide there might be a problem. <em>You are the stress ball
  and the human.</em> Trapped inside a mind. The word mental doesn't have the
  right ring to it does it? No, I didn't think so.</p>
<p>What would a stress ball eat for dinner? Something squishy maybe? My bet
  is Jell-o. Yeah Jell-o would be a wonderful treat for a stress ball. That's
  just how it tends to work out.</p>
<p>Guess that's kind of silly huh?</p>
<p>They take away all the simple amenities you are used to. Fortunately I have
  this paper and pencil. That feels like home. Who knew writing could feel like
  home. Talk about a crazy idea. Yet here we are hoping for the best.</p>
<p>People think they'll actually get out of there.</p>
<p><em>They</em> think they're better, but who actually says they are better?</p>
<p>Are we back to the squishy ball? Does the squishy ball do all? I really
  haven't a clue. That's just how this life tends to work. Talk about a
  fucking (sorry for <a href="swearing.php">swearing</a>) mess here.</p>
<p>So let it be, allow it to stand. Don't let things go and believe they won't
  happen again. They will you know it. It's okay to believe in something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="img/tree-sun.jpg"/></p>
<p class="p30" style="text-align:center"><strong>Embarrassment</strong></p>
<p>It's no life to live. Not a place to be or understand why we are all here
  and living this life long before it comes to an end.</p>
<p>It has to find some way to possibly be there for a moment, a second, a
  lifetime when possible, yet here we are stressed beyond any control, we are
  destroying ourselves one breath of air at a time. Waste of a soul. Death of
  a life. It ain't worth trying if all you plan on is dying. So let those
  thoughts go, don't believe what the devil inside is whispering in your
  head.</p>
<p>So you mess up every once in a while, you live through it and make
  your way past it. Great for some and it all goes away. For others, it
  doesn't and we are left to our own devices. It ain't all good when you don't
  get a poinnt to stand your ground. So make your way and see it through
  to the end as it were if only to know nothing at all.</p>
<p>So don't be going towards that light it's not your time yet, you don't want
  to face that fight. It's not meant to be or discovered that way.</p>
<p>Only a moment is gone, but decided by whom?!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="img/ray.jpg"/></p>
<p>Are you the one who's to be in charge here? I don't know. I can't tell you
  who would know. Maybe it's the squishy ball in charge. Now that's what we're
  talking about.</p>
<p>It's you and me buddy, your funny green face and me. We're in it together.
  Yet my friend in order to help me has to get squished. Is that a healthy
  friendship?</p>
<p>Makes you wonder, doesn't it?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="img/squoze2.jpg"/></p>
<p>All this life is a bit of words on a paper. Nothing more than that. So
  that's how it all works. Don't stop going, gotta make it through somehow. Let's
  live.</p>
