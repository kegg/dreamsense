<h2>January 22, 2020</h2>

<p><span class="drop">T</span>ime didn't exist for the man in the white room.
  The green ball smiled back at him. A smile of all things. Why would a
  smile even matter at this point in the game?</p>
<p>He's a stress ball. I squeeze him. So why the smile? If you got squoze,
  would you be smiling? I doubt it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="img/squoze.jpg"><br>
  <span class="p10">Yes, he really exists.</p>
<p>Maybe he knew they did a check on me. That's possible. And he's just
  laughing at me. Silly stress ball, staring back at me with his green
  self.</p>
<p>One has to wonder how and why he can smile at me. Where does that smile
  come from? I wish I could smile back and feel normal again.</p>
<p>What exactly is normal?</p>
<p>How do you grasp onto it? WHen they gave me the stress ball they took him
  away from his friends. He's alone. He only has me, so he won't be alone
  for long. Silly stress ball.</p>
<p>If our positions were reversed, would I be the one smiling at the human?</p>
<p>Who is the human and who is the stress ball?</p>
<p>When you can't decide there might be a problem. <em>You are the stress ball
  and the human.</em> Trapped inside a mind. The word mental doesn't have the
  right ring to it does it? No, I didn't think so.</p>
<p>What would a stress ball eat for dinner? Something squishy maybe? My bet
  is Jell-o. Yeah Jell-o would be a wonderful treat for a stress ball. That's
  just how it tends to work out.</p>
<p>Guess that's kind of silly huh?</p>
<p>They take away all the simple amenities you are used to. Fortunately I have
  this paper and pencil. That feels like home. Who knew writing could feel like
  home. Talk about a crazy idea. Yet here we are hoping for the best.</p>
<p>People think they'll actually get out of there.</p>
<p><em>They</em> think they're better, but who actually says they are better?</p>
<p>Are we back to the squishy ball? Does the squishy ball do all? I really
  haven't a clue. That's just how this life tends to work. Talk about a
  fucking (sorry for <a href="swearing.php">swearing</a>) mess here.</p>
<p>So let it be, allow it to stand. Don't let things go and believe they won't
  happen again. They will you know it. It's okay to believe in something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="img/tree-sun.jpg"/></p>
<p class="p30" style="text-align:center"><strong>Embarrassment</strong></p>
<p>It's no life to live. Not a place to be or understand why we are all here
  and living this life long before it comes to an end.</p>
<p>It has to find some way to possibly be there for a moment, a second, a
  lifetime when possible, yet here we are stressed beyond any control, we are
  destroying ourselves one breath of air at a time. Waste of a soul. Death of
  a life. It ain't worth trying if all you plan on is dying. So let those
  thoughts go, don't believe what the devil inside is whispering in your head.</p>
