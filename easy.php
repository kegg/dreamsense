<p><span class="drop">I</span> am waiting to hear back on some scary things as 
of late. It's the big "C" word. Yeah, I'm waiting to hear back to see if I need 
to get tested for <span class="red">cancer</span>. When you hear the word 
<span class="red">cancer</span> you aren't certain what to think at first. 
I mean, you freak out for a second or two, but you don't know what to say. 
You think, oh this isn't happening to me. It can't happen to me! Well, 
let me tell you. It can happen to anyone.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just want to give up on <a href="diary.php">life</a>. 
Suicide isn't always an option. It might feel like an option at times, 
but it really isn't. If you ever feel like you want to take your life, 
please <strong>see someone and get 
help</strong>.</p>
